I'll be giving two virtual presentatios at the upcoming 4S/EASST Conference, originally scheduled to be held in Prague.

The first one is call "Civic Data for the Anthropocene: Visualizing Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics." The second will be a co-presentation with James Adams (UC Irvine) called “Installation Ethnography: Curation, Aesthetics, Experiments.”
