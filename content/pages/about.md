**I am a graduate student in Cultural Anthropology at the University of California Irvine.**

My research focuses on civic data infrastructures, archiving and environmental advocacy in response to “the Anthropocene” broadly conceived.

I hold a BA in Communication, Media and Cultural Studies (University of Bremen, 2017) and a prospective MA in Science and Technology Studies (Goethe University Frankfurt, 2020). I am a fellow of the Fulbright Foundation and the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung).

I currently participate in and co-develop a series of collaborative research, teaching and infrastructure projects:

* [Quotidian Anthropocenes,](http://disaster-sts-network.org/content/quotidian-anthropocene/essay) sponsored by Haus der Kulturen der Welt and Max Planck Institue for the History of Science Berlin
* [Visualizing Toxic Places,](http://centerforethnography.org/content/cfp-visualizing-toxic-places/essay) sponsored by UCI’s Center for Ethnography
* Design for the [Platform for Collaborative Experimental Ethnography (PECE)](https://worldpece.org/) (sign up for the monthly newsletter [here](https://github.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=28f50ca38ef652df957d5cbd6&id=0ed4893b1f)!)
* Graduate Teaching associate for the UCI lower-division course [Environmental Injustice.](https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/19799)

My writing has appeared in peer-reviewed journals, edited volumes and public-facing reports. In 2017, my ethnographic study of free wireless network activism in German refugee camps received the DARIAH-DE DH Award for emerging scholars in the digital humanities. I have also produced visual work, including a short documentary film on hacker communities in Istanbul and a science communication series titled “[Tactics for Quotidian Anthropocenes](https://www.4sonline.org/blog/post/tactics_for_quotidian_anthropocenes).”
