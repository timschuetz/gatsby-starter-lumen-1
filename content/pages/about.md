**I am a graduate student in Cultural Anthropology at the University of California Irvine.**

My research focuses on civic data infrastructures, archiving and environmental advocacy in response to “the Anthropocene” broadly conceived.

I hold a BA in Communication, Media and Cultural Studies (University of Bremen, 2017) and a prospective MA in Science and Technology Studies (Goethe University Frankfurt, 2020). I am a fellow of the Fulbright Foundation and the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung).

My writing has appeared in peer-reviewed journals, edited volumes and public-facing reports. In 2017, my ethnographic study of free wireless network activism in German refugee camps received the DARIAH-DE DH Award for emerging scholars in the digital humanities. I have also produced visual work, including a short documentary film on hacker communities in Istanbul and a science communication series titled “[Tactics for Quotidian Anthropocenes](https://www.4sonline.org/blog/post/tactics_for_quotidian_anthropocenes).”
